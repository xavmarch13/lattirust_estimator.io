# Compact versions of SIS

In practice, basic SIS leads to large key sizes and large parameters overall. Thinking about $\bold{A} \in \mathbb{Z}_q^{h\times w}$ with $m > n$ leads to at least quadratic complexity. This is why more compact version have been introduced like Ring-SIS and Module-SIS. By using such underlying structures, we are able to obtain much smaller key sizes in the schemes that use an SIS instance as the basis for their security. As a refresher on the module and ring structure the reader can consult {{< cite "lambek2009lectures" >}}. Consider that we choose some $h = 2^k$ and that we choose the columns of $\bold{A}$ to be elements of the ring $\mathbb{Z}_q / \langle x^h + 1 \rangle$, if $h$ is a power of two it is irreducible over the rationals, then we need to precise less elements to describe the same SIS instance. Using a module, we can get an even compacter structure.

## Ring SIS

<div style="background-color: rgba(173, 216, 230, 0.3); padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px; margin: 10px 0;">

**Definition:{{< cite "langlois2015worst" >}}**  
We define the **Ring Short Integer Solution (Ring-SIS)** problem as follows $RSIS(h, w, q, \beta, p)$. Let:

- \( R_q = \mathbb{Z}_q / \langle x^h + 1 \rangle \), where \( h \) is a power of two (ensuring \( x^h + 1 \) is irreducible over \( \mathbb{Q} \)),

Given $a_1, \ldots, a_w$ in R_q, chosen independently from the uniform distribution, find $s_1, \ldots, s_w \in R$ such that:

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{w}a_i s_i = 0 \pmod{q} \text{ and } 0 < \|\mathbf{s}\|_p \leq \beta
$$

where $\bold{s} = (s_1, \ldots, s_w)^T \in R^m$.

</div>

Each ring element $r\in R$ can be interpreted as an $h$-dimensional vector with coefficients $r_i$ such that $r = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}r_ix^i$. Now if we compare RSIS to SIS, each matrix element $a_i$ in RSIS actually actually corresponds to the $h\times h$ nega-circulant matrix. In this setup, R-SIS is just a variant of SIS where $\bold{A}$ is restricted to being block negacirculant $\bold{A}= [Rot(a_1)|\ldots|Rot(a_n)]$ where Rot(b) is defined as


$$
\text{Rot}(b) =
\begin{bmatrix}
b_0 & -b_{h-1} & -b_{h-2} & \cdots & -b_1 \\
b_1 & b_0 & -b_{h-1} & \cdots & -b_2 \\
b_2 & b_1 & b_0 & \cdots & -b_3 \\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
b_{h-1} & b_{h-2} & b_{h-3} & \cdots & b_0
\end{bmatrix}
$$

### Security and estimator

To estimate the security of a ring SIS instance, we then effectively transform an RSIS instance $RSIS(h, w, q, \beta, p)$ to an SIS instance $SIS(h, h \cdot w, q, \beta, p)$. You can instanciate an instance of RSIS in the estimator via
`RSIS.new(h, w, q, length_bound, Norm)`.

## Module SIS

<div style="background-color: rgba(173, 216, 230, 0.3); padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px; margin: 10px 0;">

**Definition:{{< cite "langlois2015worst" >}}**  
We define the **Module Short Integer Solution (Module-SIS)** problem as follows $MSIS(h, w, d, q, \beta, p)$. Let:

- \( R = \mathbb{Z}_q / \langle x^h + 1 \rangle \), where \( h \) is a power of two,
- \( \mathcal{M} = R^d \), a rank-\( d \) module over \( R \),


Given $\bold{a_1}, \ldots, \bold{a_w} \in R_q^d$ chosen independently from the uniform distribution, find $s_1, \ldots, s_w \in R$ such that:

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{w}\bold{a_i} s_i = 0 \pmod{q} \text{ and } 0 < \|\mathbf{s}\|_p \leq \beta
$$

where $\bold{s} = (s_1, \ldots, s_w)^T \in R^m$.

</div>

Each element $\bold{a_i}$ can be seen as d coefficients in the ring and as such can be seen as an $h\cdot d \times h$ matrix. This leads a module SIS problem to be visualized as such in a standard SIS problem:

\[
\mathbf{A} =
\begin{bmatrix}
\text{Rot}(a_{1,1}) & \text{Rot}(a_{1,2}) & \cdots & \text{Rot}(a_{1,w}) \\
\text{Rot}(a_{2,1}) & \text{Rot}(a_{2,2}) & \cdots & \text{Rot}(a_{2,w}) \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
\text{Rot}(a_{d,1}) & \text{Rot}(a_{d,2}) & \cdots & \text{Rot}(a_{d,w})
\end{bmatrix},
\]

where each block \(\text{Rot}(a_{i,j})\) is a negacyclic matrix defined as:

\[
\text{Rot}(b) =
\begin{bmatrix}
b_0 & -b_{n-1} & -b_{n-2} & \cdots & -b_1 \\
b_1 & b_0 & -b_{n-1} & \cdots & -b_2 \\
b_2 & b_1 & b_0 & \cdots & -b_3 \\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
b_{n-1} & b_{n-2} & b_{n-3} & \cdots & b_0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Security and estimator

To estimate the security of a module SIS instance, we then effectively transform an MSIS instance $MSIS(h, w, d, q, \beta, p)$ to an SIS instance $SIS(h \cdot d, h \cdot w, q, \beta, p)$. Also, note that by using $d=1$, we effectively come back to RSIS. Indeed, modules are a generalization of rings. You can instanciate an instance of MSIS in the estimator via
`MSIS.new(h, w, d, q, length_bound, Norm)`.
